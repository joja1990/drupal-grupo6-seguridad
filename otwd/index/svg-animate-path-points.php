Set the coordinates from the point we calculated with getPointAtLength.  Animating the points At this point, weâre ready to begin animating the points with d3-timer and d3-ease.  It works a bit like the CSS animation timing function.  To better understand the This can affect the actual rendered lengths of paths; including text paths, animation paths, and various stroke operations.

With the point before and the point after a position, we can calculate the current angle of the path segment.  This is a SVG built in function âgetPointAtLengthâ, it returns exactly what it is called, the x and y coordinate of a certain point on a path.  To reverse the direction of the points of in a closed shape like this one in Illustrator, right-click on the path and select âmake compound pathâ, then click the âreverse path directionâ button in the Attributes panel.  rotate (attribute) â used as an attribute for animateMotion to control whether an object is automatically rotated so that its x-axis points in the same direction (or opposite direction) as the directional tangent vector of the motion path.  For example path. x + &quot;,&quot; + p.  When we create paths that will be animated, we have to keep in mind that all points present in the final path, also need to be there in the initial shape. 574 100 63. lineTo (75,75); path.
