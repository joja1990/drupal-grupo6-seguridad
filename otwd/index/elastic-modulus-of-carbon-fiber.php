It is used as reinforcement for plastics in composites for aerospace, marine, automotive, and other industrial applications.  .  Carbon fibers are made of In simple terms, Tensile Modulus is a measurement of a material’s ability to withstand changes in length when tension or compression is applied.  As the composite becomes more elastic (when adding elastic fillers such CNTs on carbon fibers), the viscoelastic (time-dependent) behavior diminishes, and the frequency dependence of the storage modulus vanishes.  As the fiber is heated, the modulus gradually increases.  Rubber has a Poisson ratio close to 0. 2: 207: 72: Transverse Modulus: E2: GPa: .
